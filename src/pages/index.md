        Arakan became one of the earliest regions in Southeast Asia to embrace
        Dharmic religions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. Islam arrived
        with Arab merchants in the 8th century. The Kingdom of Mrauk U emerged
        as an independent Arakanese kingdom for 300 years. During the Age of
        Discovery and Bengal Subah's major economic development, Arakan caught
        the interest of the Dutch East India Company and the Portuguese Empire.
        In the middle of the 17th century, it was dominated by the Islamic
        Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Arakan steadily declined from the 18th century
        onwards after its loss to the Mughal Empire.

        BASED on Theravada Buddhism, the Rakhine culture, literature, music and
        fine arts have flourished. The Rakhine oillamp choral dancing is famous;
        so are the traditional slash-andburn dancing by Thet ethnic people,
        plate dancing by ethnic Maramargrees, bottle-dancing on the head by
        Dainet ethnic people and horn-dancing by ethnic Mros famous in their own

  heading: Rakhine State
  description: >
    In 1982, the Burmese nationality law stripped many inhabitants of the region
    of their citizenship. In 1989, the Burmese military junta changed the
    official name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name
    of Arakan State to Rakhine State — a name reflecting the dominance of the
    Rakhine majority.[2] Many in the Rohingya minority strongly opposed the
    change. The region has seen conflict between the Burmese state, Rakhine
    nationalists and Rohingya rebels. In more recent times, Rakhine State has
    been notable for the exodus of refugees into neighboring countries because
    of military operations by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces).
