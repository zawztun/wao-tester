        Arakan became one of the earliest regions in Southeast Asia to embrace
        Dharmic religions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. Islam arrived
        with Arab merchants in the 8th century. The Kingdom of Mrauk U emerged
        as an independent Arakanese kingdom for 300 years. During the Age of
        Discovery and Bengal Subah's major economic development, Arakan caught
        the interest of the Dutch East India Company and the Portuguese Empire.
        In the middle of the 17th century, it was dominated by the Islamic
        Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Arakan steadily declined from the 18th century
        onwards after its loss to the Mughal Empire.

        Min Saw Mon's successors in the Kingdom of Mrauk U sought to end the
        Bengal Sultanate's hegemony. Min Khayi (Ali Khan) was the first to
        challenge Bengali hegemony. Ba Saw Phyu (Kalima Shah) defeated Bengal
        Sultan Rukunuddin Barbak Shah in 1459. Min Bin (Zabuk Shah) conquered
        Chittagong. Taking advantage of the Mughal Empire's invasion campaign of
        Bengal, the Arakan navy and pirates dominated a coastline of 1000 miles,
        spanning from the Sundarbans to Moulmein. The kingdom's coastline was
        frequented by Arab, Dutch, Danish and Portuguese traders. Control of the
        Kaladan River and Lemro River valleys led to increased international
        trade, making Mrauk U prosperous. The reigns of Min Phalaung (Sikender
        Shah), Min Rajagiri (Salim Shah I) and grandson Min Khamaung (Hussein
        Shah) strengthened the wealth and power of Mrauk U.[8]: 20–21  Arakan
        colluded in the slave trade with the Portuguese settlement in
        Chittagong. After conquering the port city of Syriam in the early 1600s,
        Arakan appointed the Portuguese mercenary Philip De Brito e Nicota as
        the governor of Syriam. But Nicota later transferred Syriam to the
        authority of Portuguese India.[8]: 21

        Even after independence from the Sultans of Bengal, the Arakanese kings continued the custom of maintaining Muslim titles.[20] They compared themselves to Sultans and fashioned themselves after Mughal rulers. They also continued to employ Indians and Muslims in prestigious positions within the royal administration.[21] The court adopted Indian and Islamic fashions from neighbouring Bengal.[21][18] Mrauk U hosted mosques, temples, shrines, seminaries and libraries.[8]: 22  Syed Alaol was a renowned poet of Arakan.[22] Indian and Muslim influence continued on Arakanese affairs for 350 years.


        In 1660, Shah Shuja, the brother of Emperor Aurangzeb and a claimant of the Peacock Throne, received asylum in Mrauk U. Members of Shuja's entourage were recruited in the Arakanese army and court. They were kingmakers in Arakan until the Burmese conquest.[23] Arakan suffered a major defeat to the forces of Mughal Bengal during the Battle of Chittagong in 1666, when Mrauk U lost control of southeast Bengal. The Mrauk U dynasty's reign continued until the 18th century.

    In 1982, the Burmese nationality law stripped many inhabitants of the region
    of their citizenship. In 1989, the Burmese military junta changed the
    official name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name
    of Arakan State to Rakhine State — a name reflecting the dominance of the
    Rakhine majority.[2] Many in the Rohingya minority strongly opposed the
    change. The region has seen conflict between the Burmese state, Rakhine
    nationalists and Rohingya rebels. In more recent times, Rakhine State has
    been notable for the exodus of refugees into neighboring countries because
    of military operations by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces).
