description: 'Arakanese (also known as Rakhine /rəˈkaɪn/; Burmese: ရခိုင်ဘာသာ,
  MLCTS: ra.hkuing bhasa [ɹəkʰàɪɴ bàθà]) is a language closely related to
  Burmese, of which it is often considered a dialect. "Arakan" is the former
  name for the Rakhine region. Arakanese can be divided into three dialects:
  Sittwe–Marma (about two thirds of speakers), Ramree, and Thandwe.[2] It is the
  native language of the Rakhine, Marma and Kamein peoples.'

## Vocabulary[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arakanese_language&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Vocabulary")]

There are significant vocabulary differences from Standard Burmese. Some are native words with no cognates in Standard Burmese, like "sarong" (လုံခြည် in Standard Burmese, ဒယော in Arakanese). Others are loan words from [Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language "Bengali language"), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), and [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), not found in Standard Burmese. An example is "hospital," which is called ဆေးရုံ in Standard Burmese, but is called သေပ်လှိုင် (pronounced \[θeɪʔ l̥àɪɴ]/\[ʃeɪʔ l̥àɪɴ]) in Arakanese, from English "sick lines." Other words simply have different meanings (e.g., "afternoon", ညစ in Arakanese and ညနေ in Standard Burmese). Moreover, some archaic words in Standard Burmese are preferred in Arakanese. An example is the first person pronoun, which is အကျွန် in Arakanese (not ကျွန်တော်, as in Standard Burmese).

## Phonology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arakanese_language&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Phonology")]

Arakanese prominently uses the /r/ sound, which has merged to the /j/ sound in standard Burmese. This is particularly interesting because the use of the ‘r’ sound is something that is avoided with Burmese speakers. For example, Burmese pronounce the words, “tiger” or “to hear” (both words have similar pronunciation) as “kya,” where in Arakanese, it would be pronounced as, “kra.”[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-5) Also, Arakanese has merged various vowel sounds like ဧ (\[e]) vowel to ဣ (\[i]). Hence, a word like "blood" is သွေး (\[θwé]) in standard Burmese while it pronounced \[θwí] in Arakanese. According to speakers of standard Burmese, Arakanese only has an intelligibility of seventy-five percent with Burmese.[\[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-6) Moreover, there is less voicing in Arakanese than in Standard Burmese, occurring only when the consonant is unaspirated.[\[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOkell19954,_14-7) Unlike in Burmese, voicing never shifts from \[θ] to \[ð].[\[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOkell199514-8)

Because Arakanese has preserved the /r/ sound, the /-r-/ medial (preserved only in writing in Standard Burmese with the diacritic ြ) is still distinguished in the following consonant clusters: /ɡr- kr- kʰr- ŋr- pr- pʰr- br- mr- m̥r- hr-/.

The Arakanese dialect has a higher frequency of open vowels weakening to /ə/. An example is the word for "salary," (လခ) which is \[la̰ɡa̰] in standard Burmese, but \[ləkha̰] in Arakanese.

The following are [consonantal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant"), [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") and [rhyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme "Rhyme") differences from Standard Burmese found in the Arakanese [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect "Dialect"):[\[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOkell1995-9)[\[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoughton1897453%E2%80%9361-10)
